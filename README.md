# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Web App

A lightweight web application built using **Flask** that predicts whether a person has diabetes based on health metrics. The prediction is powered by a trained **XGBoost classifier** on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, with data balancing using **SMOTE**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This app takes in 8 medical inputs from the user (like glucose level, BMI, age, etc.) and uses a machine learning model to classify whether the individual is likely diabetic or not. Itâ€™s intended as a proof-of-concept or educational tool â€” not a diagnostic medical tool.
